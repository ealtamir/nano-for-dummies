    "This tutorial is intended to complement the [official Nano documentation](https://docs.nano.org/integration-guides/the-basics/). It implements almost all important functions needed to create valid blocks. The code was written in a simply and intuitive manner so that it's easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reading this tutorial you will understand how a seed is created and how private/public key pairs are derived from it. These in turn are used to send and receive funds. You will understand how to build Nano blocks and what needs to be done for the network to consider them valid. Finally, once funds have been sent and received, we will import the seed to a popular wallet which will help us reinforce the fact that the seed is the key to any funds. \n",
